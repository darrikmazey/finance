= Prawn/Security: Popular Password Protection & Permissions for Prawn PDFs

Prawn/Security adds encryption, password protection, and permissions to Prawn. 

== Usage

See the examples/ directory and/or the RDoc for detailed info. Basically, it's
as simple as the first example:

  require 'prawn/security'

  Prawn::Document.generate("hello_foo.pdf") do
    text "Hello, world!"
    encrypt_document :user_password => 'foo', :owner_password => 'bar',
      :permissions => { :print_document => false }
  end

This creates a document that requires the password 'foo' to be opened,
and cannot be printed without entering the owner password 'bar'.

If you want to prohibit most anyone from performing a certain activity, you can
pass :owner_password => :random to generate a probably-unguessable owner 
password.
